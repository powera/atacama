# Atacama

(README generated by LLM)

Atacama is a web platform for sharing and discussing messages with rich semantic formatting. It transforms simple text with special tags into beautifully formatted content, making it easy to distinguish different types of content like quotes, technical explanations, or alternate viewpoints.

## Overview

Atacama acts as a collaborative message board where formatting helps convey meaning. Users can:
- Format technical explanations that stand out visually
- Quote and discuss content with clear visual distinction
- Mark content generated by AI tools for transparency
- Annotate Chinese text with hover-based translations
- Create threaded discussions with parent/child relationships

## Key Features

- **Smart Formatting**: Use simple tags to apply meaningful styling
- **Message Threading**: Follow conversations through connected messages
- **Chinese Support**: Hover over Chinese characters for translations
- **Quote Collection**: Automatically indexes and collects quotes
- **AI Integration**: Special formatting for AI-generated content

## Message Formatting

Atacama uses semantic color tags to give meaning to content. Here are some common tags:

- `<green>` for technical explanations and code discussion
- `<quote>` for quotes and referenced content
- `<orange>` for counterpoints and alternative views
- `<teal>` for AI-generated content

These tags can be combined in various ways to create rich, meaningful content.

## Getting Started

The web interface provides everything needed to participate:

1. Visit the message submission page
2. Write your message using color tags
3. Preview how it will look
4. Submit to share with others

Messages can be viewed in either a stream of recent content or as threaded discussions.

## Current Status

Atacama is in active development with a pre-release instance running at earlyversion.com. The platform includes:

- Web-based message submission and viewing
- Secure user authentication
- Message moderation
- Comprehensive activity logging
